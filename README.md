#  Sales Analysis Dashboard Streamlit App - Python

##  Introduction
An attempt has been made to recreate the interactive **Sales Analysis Dashboard** originally built in **Power BI**â€”using Python and Streamlit, developing it into an interactive web-based application. It provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across different regions, products, time periods and zones. The dashboard enables quick insights into revenue trends, top-performing categories, customer segmentation, and KPIs such as total sales, profit margins, and monthly growth.
