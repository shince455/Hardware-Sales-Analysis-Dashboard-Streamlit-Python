#  Sales Analysis Dashboard Streamlit App - Python

##  Introduction
An attempt has been made to recreate the interactive **Sales Analysis Dashboard** originally built in **Power BI**—using Python and Streamlit, developing it into an interactive web-based application. It provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across different regions, products, time periods and zones. The dashboard enables quick insights into revenue trends, top-performing categories, customer segmentation, and KPIs such as total sales, profit margins, and monthly growth.

##  Files Included
- `Sales_Analysis.py` – Python sourse file
- `Dashboard_Screenshot.png` – A preview of the dashboard
##  Key Features

- Total Sales, Profit, and Units Sold by month and region
- Dynamic filtering by product category and customer segment
- Year-over-Year comparison and percentage growth
- Top 5 performing products and customers by revenue
- Region-wise breakdown using interactive maps
- Monthly trend analysis using line chart

## Key takeaways from the analysis:

- Top-Performing Products: Identified the highest revenue-generating products and categories, helping prioritize inventory and marketing strategies.
- Sales by Region: Revealed regional sales trends and highlighted high-performing states, enabling location-based decision-making.
- Revenue Growth: Tracked monthly and yearly revenue trends to evaluate the company’s growth trajectory over time.
- Customer Segments: Analyzed customer types and their impact on total revenue.
- Profitability Analysis: Used DAX to calculate profit margins and compare performance across different product categories and customer segments.
- Currency Normalization: A custom column was created to standardize foreign currency sales into a single currency (INR), using conditional logic.
All results were validated using SQL queries on the original dataset, ensuring accuracy and consistency between raw data and visual representation.
